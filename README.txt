# Tama-Saur: Prehistoric Overlay Timer (RAWR!!)

A kawaii pixel-art Pomodoro timer that floats on your screen.

## Features
- **Overlay Mode**: The dino roams your entire screen.
- **Draggable**: Move the shell by grabbing the top label.
- **Resizable**: Scale the shell using the handle at the bottom right.
- **Customizable**: Swap the pixel art in the `assets` folder to create your own character!

## How to use
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone this repo.
3. Run `npm install` in the terminal.
4. Run `npm start` to launch the timer.

## Design your own Dino
Simply replace the files in the `assets/` folder with your own `.png` sprites created using https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite/. Keep the file names identical!
(IMPORTANT! Choose the Spritesheet layout options for png on piksel so that it shows Rows: 1 or else the animations will look funky.)

Have fun!!
